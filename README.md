Created comprehensive test automation framework using Java and Maven to test a custom e-commerce web application.
The project demonstrates my expertise in designing scalable test solutions with industry-standard practices.

Key Technical Components:

Selenium WebDriver for browser automation

TestNG for test organization and execution

Maven for dependency management

Allure Reports for detailed test visualization and analytics

Page Object Model design pattern for maintainable test code

Data-driven approach with external test data sources

Automation Capabilities Implemented:

Dynamic element interaction (buttons, links, form fields)

Alert handling with custom verification mechanisms

Modal popup interaction and validation

Complex scrollbar operations using JavaScript Executor

Dropdown menu testing with multiple selection strategies

Search functionality testing with various input combinations

Notable Feature: Failure Analysis Demonstration
I deliberately included a failing test case to demonstrate how the framework identifies, cause of failures. The Allure report provides comprehensive debugging information at failure point.

What makes this project unique is that I built both the testing framework AND the target web application (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a controlled testing environment that demonstrates real-world testing scenarios.
